Let's get started:
the first thing that you should do is to clone this repository in a directory like `/home/user/Desktop` or anywhere that you want.
then you should download the burp suite professional jar file from official site: [https://portswigger.net/burp/releases].
NOTE: you should download the .jar file. (version doesn't matter) then put the .jar file in the directory that you've cloned the repository.

I prefered the 24.4.4 stable version, so I'll describe based on this version. But you should note that you need to change the version of the file if you downloaded another version!
then you should head to the directory that you cloned the repository and copy the `BurpLoaderKeygen.jar` file and the image `burp.jpg`.
